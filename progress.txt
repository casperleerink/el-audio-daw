## 2026-01-29 - Optimistic Update Utilities

### Completed
Created `apps/web/src/lib/optimistic.ts` with the following utilities:

1. **`tempId<TableName>()`** - Generates temporary client IDs prefixed with `temp_` followed by a UUID. Used for optimistic creates before server confirms with real ID.

2. **`MaybePending<T>`** - Type alias for entities that may be in a pending state. Adds optional `_pending` flag.

3. **`isPending(entity)`** - Checks if an entity has a temp ID (starts with `temp_` prefix). Useful for disabling certain actions on pending entities.

4. **`showRollbackToast(action)`** - Shows a toast notification for failed mutations with the message "Failed to [action]. Changes reverted."

### Notes for next person
- The utilities follow the pattern defined in FR-8 of the PRD
- The `tempId` function is constrained to `TableNames` from Convex's generated types for type safety
- These utilities are foundational - the next task should be implementing optimistic updates for track mutations
- The existing `useOptimisticTrackUpdates` hook in `apps/web/src/hooks/` handles track control updates (mute/solo/gain) but doesn't use Convex's `withOptimisticUpdate` API - it uses local React state instead
- Consider whether to refactor that hook to use these new utilities or keep both patterns depending on use case

## 2026-01-29 - Track Mutations Optimistic Updates

### Completed
Implemented optimistic updates for all track mutations using Convex's `withOptimisticUpdate` API.

**New file created:** `apps/web/src/lib/trackOptimisticUpdates.ts`
- `createTrackOptimisticUpdate` - Instantly adds a new track with a temp ID
- `updateTrackOptimisticUpdate` - Instantly applies name/mute/solo/gain changes
- `deleteTrackOptimisticUpdate` - Instantly removes track from list
- `reorderTracksOptimisticUpdate` - Instantly reorders tracks in the cache

**Files modified:**
1. `packages/backend/convex/tracks.ts`
   - Added optional `projectId` arg to `updateTrack` and `deleteTrack` mutations (used for optimistic update cache invalidation)

2. `apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx`
   - Wired up all track mutations with `withOptimisticUpdate`
   - Removed loading states (`isAddingTrack`, `deletingTrackId`) since optimistic updates make actions feel instant
   - Replaced manual error toasts with `showRollbackToast` for consistent error handling

3. `apps/web/src/components/VirtualizedTrackList.tsx`
   - Removed `isAddingTrack` and `deletingTrackId` props
   - Removed `isDeleting` prop from TrackHeader
   - Simplified UI since loading states are no longer needed

### Architecture decisions
- Track mutations now use Convex's native `withOptimisticUpdate` for instant feedback
- The existing `useOptimisticTrackUpdates` hook remains for mute/solo/gain controls since those use a commit-based pattern (local state during interaction, server update on commit)
- Both patterns coexist: Convex optimistic updates for CRUD operations, local React state for continuous interactions

### Notes for next person
- Next priority task: Implement optimistic updates for clip mutations
- The `updateTrack` and `deleteTrack` mutations now accept an optional `projectId` arg - always pass it to enable optimistic updates
- If you need to check if a track is pending (temp ID), use the `isPending()` utility from `@/lib/optimistic`
