## 2026-01-27: Convex Schema Implementation

Created the Convex schema with all three required tables:
- `projects`: id, name, createdAt, updatedAt
- `projectUsers`: id, projectId, userId, role ("owner" | "collaborator"), joinedAt
- `tracks`: id, projectId, name, order, muted, solo, gain, createdAt, updatedAt

Implemented all required mutations and queries:
- `projects.ts`: createProject, updateProject, deleteProject, getProject, getUserProjects
- `tracks.ts`: createTrack, updateTrack, deleteTrack, reorderTracks, getProjectTracks

Notes for next developer:
- The auth user object uses `_id` not `id` for the user identifier
- All functions include proper authorization checks (only owners/collaborators can access)
- Real-time subscriptions are supported via Convex's useQuery hook on the client
- deleteProject cascades to delete all tracks and projectUsers
- Indexes are set up for efficient queries by project and user

Next priority tasks:
1. Create packages/audio with Elementary Audio engine
2. Build project dashboard page (/)
3. Build DAW editor page (/project/:id)
