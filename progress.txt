## 2026-01-27: Audio Engine Auto-Initialization

### Completed Tasks (from prd-ux-polish-improvements.md)
- **Remove explicit "Start Audio" button** - No longer blocks the entire UI
- **Add audio initialization loading state** - Play button shows spinner on first click
- **Handle audio initialization failure gracefully** - Toast error message on failure

### Changes Made
- Modified `apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx`:
  - Removed the blocking "Start Audio" screen that prevented users from seeing their tracks
  - Audio engine now initializes lazily on first play or timeline seek action
  - Added `isEngineInitializing` state to track initialization
  - Play button shows Loader2 spinner and is disabled during initialization
  - Stop button is also disabled during initialization
  - `initializeEngine()` now returns the engine instance for chaining
  - `handlePlay()` is now async and initializes engine if needed
  - `onSeek` handler also initializes engine if needed
  - Error toast displays on initialization failure

### Notes for Next Developer
- The audio engine is now lazy-initialized. Users can view/edit tracks before any audio action.
- The `AudioContext` is created on first user gesture (play/seek) per browser autoplay policy.
- If you add new transport actions (e.g., record), remember to call `initializeEngine()` first.
- The `engineRef.current?.isInitialized()` check prevents double initialization.

## 2026-01-27: Disable Overscroll Globally

### Completed Tasks (from prd-ux-polish-improvements.md)
- **Disable overscroll globally** - Prevent rubber-band/bounce effects that interfere with panning

### Changes Made
- Modified `apps/web/src/index.css`:
  - Added `overscroll-behavior: none` to html and body elements
  - This prevents the rubber-band/bounce effect on macOS/iOS when scrolling past boundaries
- Modified `apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx`:
  - Added `touch-none` Tailwind class to TimelineCanvas container
  - This prevents browser default touch gestures from interfering with timeline panning/zooming

### Notes for Next Developer
- The `overscroll-behavior: none` CSS property is well-supported in modern browsers
- The `touch-action: none` (via Tailwind's `touch-none`) on the timeline prevents mobile browsers from hijacking touch gestures
- If you need custom touch handling in the timeline (pinch-to-zoom), you'll need to implement it with JavaScript touch events

## 2026-01-27: Track Operations Loading States

### Completed Tasks (from prd-ux-polish-improvements.md)
- **Add loading states to track operations** - Show feedback when adding, deleting, reordering tracks

### Changes Made
- Modified `apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx`:
  - Added `isAddingTrack` state to track when a track is being created
  - Added `deletingTrackId` state to track which track is being deleted
  - `handleAddTrack()` now sets loading state and shows spinner on Add Track button
  - `handleDeleteTrack()` now sets loading state for the specific track being deleted
  - Add Track button shows Loader2 spinner and is disabled during creation
  - Delete button shows Loader2 spinner and is disabled during deletion
  - Added `deletingTrackId` prop to VirtualizedTrackList and `isDeleting` prop to TrackHeader

### Notes for Next Developer
- The loading states are per-operation: adding a track disables only the Add Track button, deleting a track disables only that track's delete button
- Reorder operations already have visual feedback via the drop indicator lines - no additional loading state was needed
- The PRD also noted "Add loading spinner to project creation button" as incomplete, but it was already implemented in `apps/web/src/routes/index.tsx` - marked as complete

## 2026-01-27: Project Loading Skeleton

### Completed Tasks (from prd-ux-polish-improvements.md)
- **Add loading overlay during project load** - Show skeleton while project data loads

### Changes Made
- Modified `apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx`:
  - Added import for `Skeleton` component from `@/components/ui/skeleton`
  - Created new `ProjectEditorSkeleton` component that mirrors the editor layout structure
  - Skeleton includes: header (back button, project name, settings), transport controls (play/stop, time, add track), track list with 3 placeholder tracks, master track controls, and timeline with ruler
  - Replaced the simple centered `Loader2` spinner with the full skeleton layout
  - Loading state now shows the skeleton until both `project` and `tracks` queries resolve

### Notes for Next Developer
- The skeleton component is intentionally simple - it shows 3 placeholder track rows which works for most use cases
- The skeleton uses the existing `Skeleton` component from `@/components/ui/skeleton` which has `animate-pulse` built in
- If the editor layout changes significantly, remember to update the skeleton to match
- The skeleton renders immediately while Convex queries are undefined, providing instant visual feedback
