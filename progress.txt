## 2026-01-27: Convex Schema Implementation

Created the Convex schema with all three required tables:
- `projects`: id, name, createdAt, updatedAt
- `projectUsers`: id, projectId, userId, role ("owner" | "collaborator"), joinedAt
- `tracks`: id, projectId, name, order, muted, solo, gain, createdAt, updatedAt

Implemented all required mutations and queries:
- `projects.ts`: createProject, updateProject, deleteProject, getProject, getUserProjects
- `tracks.ts`: createTrack, updateTrack, deleteTrack, reorderTracks, getProjectTracks

Notes for next developer:
- The auth user object uses `_id` not `id` for the user identifier
- All functions include proper authorization checks (only owners/collaborators can access)
- Real-time subscriptions are supported via Convex's useQuery hook on the client
- deleteProject cascades to delete all tracks and projectUsers
- Indexes are set up for efficient queries by project and user

Next priority tasks:
1. Create packages/audio with Elementary Audio engine
2. Build project dashboard page (/)
3. Build DAW editor page (/project/:id)

## 2026-01-27: Audio Engine Package Implementation

Created `packages/audio` with Elementary Audio engine (web-renderer + core).

**Package structure:**
- `src/index.ts` - Main exports
- `src/engine.ts` - AudioEngine class
- `src/utils.ts` - dB/gain conversion utilities

**AudioEngine class implements all required functionality (FR-1 through FR-13):**
- `initialize()` - Creates AudioContext and initializes Elementary renderer
- `play()` / `stop()` - Transport controls, resumes suspended AudioContext
- `setPlayhead(seconds)` / `getPlayhead()` - Playhead position management
- `onPlayheadUpdate(callback)` - Subscribe to playhead updates (uses requestAnimationFrame)
- `setTracks(tracks[])` - Update track states (id, muted, solo, gain in dB)
- `setMasterGain(dB)` - Set master gain
- `dispose()` - Clean up resources

**Audio routing implemented:**
- Track signals → per-track gain → sum → master gain → stereo output
- Solo logic: when any track is soloed, only soloed tracks produce audio
- Gain range: -60dB to +12dB (complete silence below -60dB)
- Smooth gain transitions using el.sm() to avoid clicks
- Each track has keyed nodes for efficient Elementary Audio graph updates

**Notes for next developer:**
- In v1, tracks produce silence (no clips yet) but full routing works
- AudioEngine must be initialized after a user gesture (browser autoplay policy)
- Playhead position is local state (not synced to Convex)
- The package uses DOM lib (not node) for AudioContext types
- Pre-existing type errors in web app are unrelated (missing route generation)

Next priority tasks:
1. Build project dashboard page (/)
2. Build DAW editor page (/project/:id)
3. Implement timeline canvas with zoom/scroll

## 2026-01-27: Project Dashboard Implementation

Implemented the project dashboard page at "/" route (FR-20, FR-22, FR-23, FR-24, FR-25).

**Files created/modified:**
- `apps/web/src/routes/index.tsx` - Dashboard with project list and creation
- `apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx` - Placeholder for DAW editor route

**Features implemented:**
- Authentication guards: Shows sign-in/sign-up for unauthenticated users (FR-22)
- Project list: Displays all user projects (owned and collaborated) in a grid (FR-23)
- "New Project" button: Creates project with "Untitled Project" name and navigates to editor (FR-24)
- Project cards: Show name, role (if collaborator), and last updated date with "Open" action (FR-25)
- Empty state: Helpful UI when user has no projects
- Loading states: Spinners while fetching data
- Toast notifications: Success/error feedback on project creation

**Notes for next developer:**
- The `/project/$id` route is a placeholder - DAW editor implementation is the next task
- Uses Convex `api.projects.getUserProjects` query with real-time subscriptions
- Uses Convex `api.projects.createProject` mutation
- TanStack Router generates `routeTree.gen.ts` during build (run `bun run build` if type errors about routes)
- Components used: Card, Button, Empty (Shadcn/UI), Lucide icons

Next priority tasks:
1. Build DAW editor page (/project/:id)
2. Implement timeline canvas with zoom/scroll
3. Implement track list with TanStack Virtual
