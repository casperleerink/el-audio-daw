# Audio Clips Feature Progress

## 2026-01-28 - Schema Changes Complete

### Completed
- Added `clips` table to Convex schema with all required fields:
  - projectId, trackId, fileId (storage ID), name, startTime, duration, audioStartTime, gain, timestamps
  - Indexes: by_track (trackId), by_project (projectId)
- Added `color` field (optional string) to tracks table for clip rendering
- Added `duration` field (optional number, in samples) to projects table
- Added `sampleRate` field (optional number) to projects table

### Implementation Notes
- All new fields are optional to maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- The `fileId` field uses `v.id("_storage")` which is Convex's built-in storage ID type
- Track colors are stored as hex strings (e.g., "#FF5733")
- Duration and sampleRate on projects will be set when first clip is uploaded

### Next Priority Tasks
1. Create Convex file upload mutation (FR-5 through FR-8)
2. Create clip CRUD mutations (create, update position, delete)
3. Create query to get clips for a project

### Files Modified
- packages/backend/convex/schema.ts

## 2026-01-28 - Clip Mutations Complete

### Completed
- Created `packages/backend/convex/clips.ts` with full clip functionality:
  - `generateUploadUrl`: Generates Convex storage upload URL for authenticated users (FR-8)
  - `validateUploadedFile`: Validates file size (100MB max, FR-6) and content type (FR-5, FR-7)
  - `createClip`: Creates clip with overlap handling (FR-9, FR-12), auto-extends project duration (FR-13)
  - `updateClipPosition`: Moves clip with overlap handling (FR-34-38), clamps to 0 (FR-38)
  - `deleteClip`: Deletes clip and associated storage file
  - `getProjectClips`: Query to get all clips for a project
  - `getProjectClipUrls`: Query to get storage URLs for VFS loading (FR-17)
  - `getFileUrl`: Query to get URL for a single stored file

### Implementation Notes
- All mutations follow existing auth pattern with `checkProjectAccess` helper
- Clip overlap handling: truncates or deletes existing clips when new/moved clip overlaps
- Project duration auto-extends to clip end + 10 seconds of samples
- Supported audio formats: WAV, MP3, AIFF, FLAC, OGG
- File validation happens after upload to Convex (delete invalid files immediately)
- Storage ID (`fileId`) is used as VFS key for Elementary Audio integration

### Next Priority Tasks
1. Set up Elementary VFS integration in AudioEngine
2. Add method to load audio buffer into VFS
3. Update audio graph to render clips at correct positions
4. Implement drag-drop zone on timeline track lanes

### Files Modified
- packages/backend/convex/clips.ts (new file)

---

## 2026-01-28 - VFS Integration Complete

### Completed
- Added Virtual File System (VFS) integration to AudioEngine (FR-15, FR-16, FR-18):
  - `loadAudioIntoVFS(key, url)`: Fetches audio from URL, decodes with Web Audio API, and loads into Elementary VFS
  - `isAudioLoaded(key)`: Checks if audio is already loaded in VFS
  - `getVFSEntry(key)`: Gets metadata (channels, duration, sampleRate) for loaded audio
  - `getVFSEntries()`: Returns all loaded VFS entries
  - `getSampleRate()`: Returns AudioContext sample rate
  - `pruneVFS(activeKeys)`: Removes unused audio from VFS
- Added `VFSEntry` interface to track loaded audio metadata
- Exported `VFSEntry` type from audio package

### Implementation Notes
- VFS key is the Convex storage ID (same as `fileId` in clips table)
- Mono audio uses key directly, stereo uses `key:0` and `key:1` format (Elementary convention)
- Metadata (channels, duration, sampleRate) is stored locally for later use when rendering clips
- Audio is only loaded once per key (caches in vfsEntries map)
- dispose() now clears vfsEntries to prevent memory leaks

### Next Priority Tasks
1. Update audio graph to render clips at correct positions (use el.sampleseq for timeline playback)
2. Implement drag-drop zone on timeline track lanes
3. Render clip rectangles on timeline canvas

### Files Modified
- packages/audio/src/engine.ts (added VFS methods and VFSEntry type)
- packages/audio/src/index.ts (exported VFSEntry type)

## 2026-01-28 - Audio Graph Clip Rendering Complete

### Completed
- Updated AudioEngine to render clips at correct timeline positions (FR-19 through FR-23):
  - Added `ClipState` interface with all required fields (id, trackId, fileId, startTime, duration, audioStartTime, gain)
  - Added `clips` array to `AudioEngineState`
  - Added `setClips(clips)` method to update clip state and re-render audio graph
  - Updated `renderGraph()` to render clips using `el.sampleseq` (mono) and `el.mc.sampleseq` (stereo)
  - Clips play at their timeline positions (`startTime` in samples converted to seconds)
  - Clips only play during their duration (FR-23)
  - Multiple clips on same track sum together (FR-21)
  - Clip gain applied before track gain (FR-20)
  - Track mute/solo logic applied at track level (FR-22)
- Exported `ClipState` type from audio package

### Implementation Notes
- Uses `el.sampleseq` for mono clips, `el.mc.sampleseq` for stereo clips
- Time signal: `el.div(el.time(), el.sr())` provides time in seconds
- Sequence format: `{time: startSeconds, value: 1}` to trigger, `{time: endSeconds, value: 0}` to stop
- If audio not loaded in VFS yet, clip renders silence (graceful degradation)
- Full stereo support: renders separate left/right channels, summed per track then to master
- Keys used throughout for efficient Elementary Audio graph updates

### Audio Signal Flow (FR-20)
```
Clip 1 (gain) ──┐
Clip 2 (gain) ──┼──> Track Sum ──> Track Gain ──┐
                                                 │
Clip 3 (gain) ──> Track Sum ──> Track Gain ─────┼──> Master Gain ──> Output
                                                 │
(mute/solo applied at track level)              │
```

### Next Priority Tasks
1. Implement drag-drop zone on timeline track lanes (FR-29-33)
2. Calculate drop position in samples from mouse position (FR-31)
3. Decode audio file client-side (FR-10)
4. Render clip rectangles on timeline canvas (FR-24-28)

### Files Modified
- packages/audio/src/engine.ts (added ClipState, setClips, updated renderGraph)
- packages/audio/src/index.ts (exported ClipState type)

## 2026-01-28 - Clip Timeline Rendering Complete

### Completed
- Implemented clip rectangle rendering on timeline canvas (FR-24 through FR-28):
  - Added `ClipData` interface for clip data passed to TimelineCanvas
  - Added `clips` and `sampleRate` props to TimelineCanvas component
  - Added `getProjectClips` query in ProjectEditor component
  - Implemented `getTrackColor(index)` function for deterministic track colors using golden angle
  - Clips render as rounded rectangles with track-inherited colors (FR-24)
  - Clip rectangles display filename with truncation for long names (FR-25)
  - Clip width calculated from duration: `duration * pixelsPerSecond / sampleRate` (FR-26)
  - Clip x position calculated from startTime: `startTime * pixelsPerSecond / sampleRate` (FR-27)
  - Normal visual state: semi-transparent fill (0.7 alpha) with solid border (FR-28)

### Implementation Notes
- Track colors generated deterministically using golden angle (137.508°) for even hue distribution
- Colors use HSL format: `hsl(hue, 65%, 55%)` for vibrant but not overwhelming colors
- Clips skip rendering when outside visible time range (horizontal culling)
- Clips skip rendering when their track is outside visible area (vertical culling)
- Text truncation uses canvas measureText for accurate width calculation
- Uses `ctx.roundRect()` for rounded corners on clip rectangles
- Sample rate defaults to 44100 if project.sampleRate is not set

### Technical Details
- Clip position formula: `clipX = (clipStartSeconds - scrollStartTime) * pixelsPerSecond`
- Clip width formula: `clipWidth = clipDurationSeconds * pixelsPerSecond`
- Track Y position: `RULER_HEIGHT + trackIndex * TRACK_HEIGHT - scrollTop`
- Clip has 2px padding inside track lane for visual separation

### Next Priority Tasks
1. Implement drag-drop zone on timeline track lanes (FR-29-33)
2. Calculate drop position in samples from mouse position (FR-31)
3. Decode audio file client-side to get duration/sample rate (FR-10)
4. Upload file to Convex on drop (FR-8)

### Files Modified
- apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx (added clip rendering to TimelineCanvas)
