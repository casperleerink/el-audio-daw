## 2026-01-27: Audio Engine Auto-Initialization

### Completed Tasks (from prd-ux-polish-improvements.md)
- **Remove explicit "Start Audio" button** - No longer blocks the entire UI
- **Add audio initialization loading state** - Play button shows spinner on first click
- **Handle audio initialization failure gracefully** - Toast error message on failure

### Changes Made
- Modified `apps/web/src/routes/project.$id.tsx`:
  - Removed the blocking "Start Audio" screen that prevented users from seeing their tracks
  - Audio engine now initializes lazily on first play or timeline seek action
  - Added `isEngineInitializing` state to track initialization
  - Play button shows Loader2 spinner and is disabled during initialization
  - Stop button is also disabled during initialization
  - `initializeEngine()` now returns the engine instance for chaining
  - `handlePlay()` is now async and initializes engine if needed
  - `onSeek` handler also initializes engine if needed
  - Error toast displays on initialization failure

### Notes for Next Developer
- The audio engine is now lazy-initialized. Users can view/edit tracks before any audio action.
- The `AudioContext` is created on first user gesture (play/seek) per browser autoplay policy.
- If you add new transport actions (e.g., record), remember to call `initializeEngine()` first.
- The `engineRef.current?.isInitialized()` check prevents double initialization.
